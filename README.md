# Responsive Navbar

I am on my journey to make small but user-friendly and good kind of features and for now instead of making full-fledged website, I am testing my knowledge by dividing those tasks in small chunks. I made this in 20 minutes but this is not a final version. It will be updated soon (When I get the motivation again).
